# Simulator-SwRegulators-PowerConsumption
This project implements a tool that could be used as a simulator for any topologies of switching regulators and different exercises of power consumption. This tool will be very useful for all those people who wants to make the simulation of a circuit as we have seen in the subject in a few seconds.

In order to develop the project, it has been selected Matlab as the main programming language. It has been considered as the best solution due to many facilities that Matlab can provide us. Matlab allows development of a GUI and the connection of this GUI with Simulink, that will be very effective in the part of Power Consumption.
